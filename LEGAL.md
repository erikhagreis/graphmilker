# LEGAL NOTICES

## Privacy policy 

### Use of personal data
Graphmilker does not view, use, store, transmit or share any of your personal 
information.

When using the Graphmilker, it will ask you to login via Facebook and authorise 
the app. This is a necessary step in order for Graphmilker to be able to browse 
a Facebook Page's posts on your behalf. This will expose some of your basic 
account information to Graphmilker. This information is not accessed, used, 
stored or shared in any way by Graphmilker.

### Data collection for analytics purposes
By connecting to the Facebook graph (logged in as yourself), you do enable 
Facebook to go about their practice of collecting data about your behavior 
online, your interests, etc. This data is not shared with Graphmilker in any 
way, _except_ when using the demo Graphmilker appId as used in demo-code and in 
the examples. In that case, standard app analytics will be collected about your 
behavior and shared with the Graphmilker author.

## Terms of use
Graphmilker enables you to browse & select posts from any Facebook Page:

- :white_check_mark: Facebook pages for brands, public figures, etc
- :x: Any individual's private timeline, even your own

Note that it is up to you to use the information obtained via Graphmilker in a 
legal way. Make sure you have the appropriate rights or approvals before 
re-using it for your purpose. Graphmilker or its author is not responsible for 
any legal claims as a result of use of this software.
